# Archived

Please go [here](https://github.com/camila314/gd-custom-object) for a much, much better implementation (that's cross-platform too).

# Fully-Functional custom object in Geometry Dash
This code is an implementation of the first completely custom trigger in GD from scratch. Code is MacOS-only but can probably be ported.

## Building
If you want to build this you need to first download the MacOSX 10.7 SDK. You can do this easily from [this repo](https://github.com/phracker/MacOSX-SDKs). Then you just need to modify the makefile to point to the correct installation path of the sdk.
